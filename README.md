# fraud_detection_anomaly_detection
This project explores multiple **anomaly detection approaches** to identify fraudulent transactions in an e-commerce setting. The objective is to compare global, local, and representation-based methods and analyze their strengths, limitations, and complementarity in detecting fraud under class imbalance and limited labeled data.
